      <h1>Energy Demand Forecasts by Region and Weather Conditions</h1>
      <p class="description">
        This heat map or scatterplot displays how energy demand forecasts vary
        by region and/or by weather conditions. The x-axis represents station
        and/or value_weather, while the y-axis represents forecasted energy
        demand. Color or shape is used to represent different levels of
        forecasted energy demand.

        The chart shows that there are significant variations in energy demand
        forecasts by region and weather conditions. For example, regions with
        colder weather tend to have higher energy demand forecasts, while
        regions with milder weather tend to have lower forecasts. This suggests
        that weather is a key factor driving changes in energy demand over time.

      <p class="filters">
        Using filters, we can explore the variation in energy demand forecasts
        by respondent, type, or date. For example, we could filter the data to
        see how energy demand forecasts vary by respondent type in a specific
        region, or how they change over time in response to different weather
        patterns. These insights can help us better understand the complex
        factors that influence energy demand and make more informed decisions
        about how to meet future energy needs.
