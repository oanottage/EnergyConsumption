      <h1>Distribution of Energy Demand Forecasts</h1>
      <p class="description">
        This histogram or frequency chart displays the distribution of energy
        demand forecasts, showing how they are spread across different values of
        energy demand. The x-axis represents value_energy, while the y-axis
        represents frequency (count). Binning is used to group the data into
        intervals, and any outliers or unusual patterns are highlighted using
        annotations or a reference line.

      <p class="trendline">
        The chart shows that energy demand forecasts are distributed across a
        range of values, with most falling within a particular range. However,
        there may be outliers or unusual patterns that warrant further
        investigation. For example, we may notice that certain respondents or
        regions consistently have higher or lower energy demand forecasts than
        others, or that certain types of weather conditions are associated with
        particularly high or low energy demand forecasts.
      </p>
      <p class="filters">
        Using filters, we can explore the distribution of energy demand
        forecasts by respondent, type, or date. For example, we could filter the
        data to see how the distribution varies by respondent type in a specific
        region, or how it changes over time in response to different weather
        patterns. These insights can help us better understand the factors that
        contribute to energy demand and identify opportunities to improve energy
        efficiency and sustainability.
